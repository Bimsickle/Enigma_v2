# Enigma_v2
Second crack at the Enigma machine, making use of rotating character blocks

This is by no means a useable encryption method, given that there are many floors not adressed such as string length and ASCII character values outside of the given range. (thse just default to a '?')

However, this was a nice challenge on creating an encryption method that can be decrypted and offers some level of complexity.
